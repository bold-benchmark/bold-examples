- `osh` replays past measurements in a private home. Data taken from the [OpenSmartHome dataset](https://github.com/TechnicalBuildingSystems/OpenSmartHomeData), by the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics in Nürnberg.
- `itm-factory` simulates a production line at the [IT'm Factory](https://itm-factory.fr/), an experimentation platform in Saint-Étienne. The production line includes four workshops: a pick-and-place workshop, a filling workshop, a robotic arm used as an assembly workshop and a packaging workshop. Items to pick are small containers ("pots of yoghurt") that are filled, closed by a lid and then packaged.
